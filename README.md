# MininGit

Simple manager for local git repositories.

**ANY contributions are welcome!**

## Usage

Basicly you need only JVM and SSH-server on your machine.

*Optionaly* you may create separate user(**better way**) for storing repositories. Via ```ssh-copy-id``` grant access to all developers.  

If you got precompiled version run ```java -jar miningit.jar --port <port-number>``` or just ```java -jar miningit.jar``` and configure application via web interface.

Or you may run it from sources with command:

```
lein run
```

Sample configs for systemd and apache2 are in folder ```config.samples```.

Feel free to contact me with any questions!
